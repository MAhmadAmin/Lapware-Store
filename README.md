# LapWare â€“ C++ Store Management System

This project is a final-term **C++ Business Application Project** by **Muhammad Ahmad Amin** for the **Programming Fundamentals (PF)** course *(1st semester, BS Computer Science)*, instructed by **Prof. Dr. Awais Hassan** at **UET (University of Engineering & Technology) Lahore**.


LapWare is a basic **store management system** developed in **C++** as part of the PF course. It was designed to simulate core operations of a laptop retail shop, such as managing products, handling customer information, and recording transactions â€” using only **console-based UI and file handling** techniques in **C and C++ procedural programming**.


## Learning Objective

The primary goal of LapWare was to apply foundational programming concepts taught in PF, including:

- Variables & Data Types  
- Conditional Statements (if/else)  
- Loops (while/for)  
- Functions  
- Structures  
- Arrays  
- File Handling in *(fopen, fprintf, fscanf, etc.)*
- Procedural Decomposition & Modular Design  


## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Platform:** Console Application  
- **IDE Used:** Visual Studio Code  


## Project Overview

LapWare simulates the basic workflow of a laptop retail store, enabling:

- Adding new laptop entries
- Displaying inventory  
- Searching laptops by model or brand 
- Recording customer purchases
- Managing data persistence through text or csv files  

All operations are handled through a simple menu-driven interface in the terminal.


## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- Console-based interface with user-friendly menus  
- Product inventory management  
- Basic customer billing simulation  
- Persistent storage using file handling  
- Clear modular code using functions and structures  
- Designed with real-world store use-case in mind
